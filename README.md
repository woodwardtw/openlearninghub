# Open Learning Hub Theme

Customized theme (based on the ancient Woo Editorial theme, no longer in existence, so we are not bothering making it a child) (sue us) used for http://openlearninghub.net/

## Some Inspirational Summary Statement

## Configuring the Front Layout Areas

TBD


##  Shortcodes 

`[feedroll category="name|id" limit="X" show="sidebar|random|all"]`

Displays an ordered list of syndicated blogs for use in content and sidebars. 

* `categpry` can be the full name or database ID for a category; the default is the All Blogs category (everything)
* `limit` how many to display; 0 = all of them
* `show` the mode for selection; sidebar is the newest; random is ... random, all is... all
